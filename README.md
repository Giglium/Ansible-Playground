[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Giglium/Ansible-Playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Giglium/Ansible-Playground) [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3ef31ac90852431a9b966360d44366d6)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/Giglium/Ansible-Playground?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=Giglium/Ansible-Playground&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade) 

## Goal

During this playground I'm going to:

* ~~Creating 2 CentOs VM to Provisioning (It's for running this playbook on a local environment)~~;
* ~~Check the disk size on the VM, if this is lower to 40GB resize them~~;
* ~~Setup Docker on the VM~~;
* ~~Docker Configuration~~:
  * ~~expose the docker API~~;
  * ~~run docker on system startup~~;
*  ~~Create a Docker swarm~~.
